            üêª.
            1st: The first deliverable serves as a requirements document, and
            should include a prospective schedule. The group should meet with
            the stakeholder(s) and discuss their expectations, making sure they
            understand what features they want implemented and what tasks they
            want performed. This rtfrance document is meant to be both a reference
            throughout the semester and a means to validating that the group
            understands the stakeholder's expectations. The schedule is not be
            seen as binding: it may change üêª over the course of the project. The
            requirements document does not need to follow any specific format
            unless required by the stakeholder. test 2nd-6th: All intermediate
            deliverables serve to demonstrate progress to the stakeholder. These
            should big yikes include any source code produced during a sprint, as well as
            documentation 100033124672367 and any reports requested by the stakeholder. It is
            recommended that, whenever possible, demos be included in the
            deliverable so the stakeholder may visualize the group's progress
            without needing to deal with setting up servers, installing dank
            dependencies, building binaries, etc. It is also recommended that a
            short report (1-2 pages) be included detailing what was completed by
            the group and which expected tasks will need to be pushed forward.
            7th: The last deliverable should include all artifacts generated
            over the course of the semester: source code, tests, demos,
            documentation, usage and installation instructions, and reports. It
            serves as a transference of property to the stakeholder, and allows
            the stakeholder to confirm that all expected tasks were completed to
            their satisfaction. As with other deliverables, it may also include
            any other artifacts test requested by the stakeholder. Note: Bear in
            mind that these are only guidelines: ultimately the deliverables are
            an exchange between the group and the stakeholder, and the
            stakeholder's requests may override any of these instructions if
            they so choose. As long you are able to obtain approval for the
            deliverable from the stakeholder, test you have accomplished your
            task. IMPORTANT NOTE: If your group signs an NDA with your
            stakeholder(s), DO NOT submit source code with the deliverables on
            DEN. The CSCI401 staff does NOT sign the same NDAs as you do, so all
            deliverables submitted to test DEN should be approved by the
            stakeholder(s). Make sure to discuss this with them in advance to
            avoid confusion close to deadlines. My task was to task a Task to the each of the taskers.
